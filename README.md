# Link Checker

This bookmarklet makes it easy for one to review the accessibility of links on a page.

The goal of this bookmarklet is NOT to find every issue for you — this is impossible.

Assessing accessibility and usability always requires human judgement.

This tool will support you by providing a consolidated view of both the accessible name and the visible label, things to look out for, and potential flags.
<b>A human (you) should be making the final judgment call!</b>

## Setup

Simply grab the bookmarklet at [khiga8.github.io/link-checker](https://khiga8.github.io/link-checker/).

Run the bookmarklet on any page where you would like to assess the link texts.

## Features

When activated, it will open a new tab with a report of all links on the specified page.

This report includes a table that surfaces the following for each link on the page:

- accessible name
- visible label
- flags detected by automated checks.
- button to log the element in the original page for further inspection
