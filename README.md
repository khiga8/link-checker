# Link Checker

This bookmarklet makes it easy for one to review the accessibility of links on a page.

The goal of this bookmarklet is NOT to find every issue for you, this is impossible.

Assessing accessibility and usability always requires human judgment.

This tool will support you by providing a consolidated view of both the accessible name and the visible label, things to look out for, and potential flags.
<b>A human (you) should be making the final judgment call!</b>

## Setup

Simply grab the bookmarklet at [khiga8.github.io/link-checker](https://khiga8.github.io/link-checker/).

Run the bookmarklet on any page where you would like to assess the link texts.

## Features

When activated, it will open a new tab with a report of all links on the specified page.

This report includes a table that surfaces the following for each link on the page:

- accessible name
- visible label
- flags detected by automated checks.
- button to log the element in the original page for further inspection
